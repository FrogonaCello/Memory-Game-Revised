## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

The project´s starting code has been extended and changed by Johanna Merbach, Frog on a Cello webdesign. 

## Contributing

I started with the given code from Udacacity. For details, check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

In addition I checked the amazin videos from the Nanodegree itself; a video, I liked, on how to set a stopwatch by [Coder´s Block](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDnfrlK2CLg&t=514s); the very helpful [Udacity´s Knowledge](https://knowledge.udacity.com/questions/1030) for my Star Rating
and I applied some very useful suggestions by my Reviewer on concat().


## How the game is played

To **start** the game click on any card. 

**Your goal** is to find a soulmate, e.g. a match, e.g. two cards with the same symbol.

To **win the game** find the soulmate of every single card. The game ends with 16 soulmates found. 

A timer, a move counter and the amount of stars will rate your process. 

The time starts, when you first click a card. 
The move counter counts every open two cards. 
The amount of stars changes from three to two after 40 clicks and again from two to one after 80 clicks. 

NB:You should´nt click on an opened card twice, as this will influence your star rating.

From that game you can expect as many fun as you put into it. 
When winning, there is a surprising change on the screen just made for you.
